# ClipSave

A chrome extension that allows you to save your clipboard history as long as you want. Easily find texts and links you've copied when you need them right in your browser, easy and stress free.

# Usage

You can copy text and it automatically saves to the clipboard for you to use later. Copy clips, mark favorites to easily gain access to your most used ones and delete whenever you want to.

# Installation

Since I haven't been able to upload it on chrome web store for now, you can download the clipsave folder, go to chrome extensions page from menu, select "load unpacked" option and then select the downloaded clipsave folder. It will automatically be installed by chrome

# Forking and contributing

Since it has to do with clipboard which can contain some sensitive data, I have left it open source so you can see what's been done with your data. Contributions are also welcome as I look to add more features continously. You can support by dropping a star. #WINKWINK#
